                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>I am currently a senior Computer Science Major at Stonehill College.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in cybersecurity but have a strong desire to learn as much as I can. Learning has always been apart of my life due to a genuine curiosty of how things work.</p>

                        <p>
                        Being from Maine, I've always enjoyed the outdoors, hiking trails, biking and wanting to understand the nature around me. 
                        That same curiosity led me to computer science and a desire to understand the technology that surrounds me.
                        </p>

                        <p>I have been a three sport athlete my whole 
                        life. Football, basketball and lacrosse were my 3 sports of choice. I then went on to be captain for football in 
                        highschool and be a leader on a championship team. Then in college I was unrecruited and got an offer to play 
                        football as a preferred walk on. This was an opportunity and I made the most of it. I worked my way onto the field 
                        freshman year and then to a rotational player sophmore year and then starting and voted captain as a junior. 
                        All this while maintaining a high GPA and being on the Dean's list every semester was a challenge.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        All of this while balancing D1 football at Stonehill, was my piece in proving <span class="italic-text">how you do anything is how you do everything</span>.
